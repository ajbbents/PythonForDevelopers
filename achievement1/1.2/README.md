<h2>Task 1.2</h2>
<h3>Task</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>name (str)</b>: Contains the name of the recipe</li>
<li><b>cooking_time (int)</b>: Contains the cooking time in minutes</li>
<li><b>ingredients (list)</b>: Contains the ingredients, each its own string</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be using dictionaries to store the needed recipe data because of the flexibility dictionaries provide. I'll be able to store the varying parts of the recipe as strings, integers, and lists of strings. The mutability of dictionaries also adds to the flexibility - allowing me to adjust, add to and remove even small pieces of each recipe as needed.</p>
<ul><li>all_recipes = []</li></ul>
<p>The outer structure will be a list so that each recipe can be stored and displayed cleanly and easily.</p>
